        <p style={{fontFamily: 'cursive',fontSize:'20px'}}>It was the day we had planned to watch a movie. The show was scheduled for 4 PM, but honestly, I wasn’t as excited as I should have been—until a thought crossed my mind.
I was going to meet him. But then, he said no.
I still remember the exact moment when my phone buzzed at 12 PM with a message. And guess what? Samar was coming to watch the movie too! We were going to watch it together! My heart swelled with happiness, and suddenly, the day felt so much more special. I was on cloud nine. I had been convinced he wouldn’t come, and now that he was, it felt like a dream. I found myself twirling around my room, thanking God a hundred times over. I was so ecstatic that I even started playing romantic music to soak in the feeling completely.
But amidst all that joy, one thought kept racing through my mind—I needed to get ready.
I need to look good, I need to look good, I kept telling myself. I knew I wouldn’t look perfect, but at least I could try. After all, it was a special day.
To be honest, this was my first time going out with my friends—ever. I had never been out like this before, and especially not for such a long time. The anticipation was making everything feel surreal, like I was stepping into an unfamiliar yet exciting world.
By 3:30 PM, it was just half an hour to go. In just thirty minutes, I would see him closely after a year—for the second time, and maybe for the last. My heart pounded with nervous excitement. Since my house was closest to the theater, I reached first. Standing outside, I found myself counting backward, as if it would somehow make time go faster.
By 3:50 PM, three of my friends had arrived, and only one was left. The most awaited one.
They were also excited to finally meet him—no one really knew who he was, except that I had liked him for more than a year. I had spoken about him countless times, but seeing him in person? That was something entirely different.And same goes for me.
I bought tickets for the five of us, and we waited... and waited. And then—there he was.
The moment he walked in, my world slowed down,as if nothing was moving,only him was coming towards me.
His walk, oh my God. There was something about the way he carried himself that made my heart race. As he approached me, an uncontrollable smile spread across my face,a big one. When he finally stood in front of me, I greeted him, “Hi, how are you?”
He smiled back and replied, “Hey, I’m good. What about you?”
“I’m good too,” I said, feeling a flutter in my chest. Then, turning to my friends, I introduced them with a grin, “So yeah, these are my friends,Aditya, Aarohi, and Priya. Oh, and Aditya and Aarohi are together. Guys, this is Samar, the one I told you about.”
They exchanged greetings, and soon, we all headed inside the theater to watch the movie. Of course, he and I sat together. I couldn't believe it,there I was, sitting beside him, sharing a moment I had never dared to imagine. It felt so special, so surreal. We had a great conversation, his words flowing effortlessly, and I found myself lost in the rhythm of our exchange.
As the movie played, I couldn't help but steal glances at him. I wondered what he was thinking,was he seeing me just as a friend? I looked down at my lap, a soft smile playing on my lips, and tried to focus back on the screen. Time flew by in the blink of an eye, and before I knew it, the movie was over. We clicked some pictures together, capturing the moment that I still hold onto. Even now, I can't bring myself to delete them. It's not like I think of him all the time... but yes, I do. How can I ever forget my first love? No one ever truly forgets their first love, do they?
He had to leave early,his father was quite strict, and within a few minutes, he was gone. Aditya left too for the same reason, leaving just the three of us,Aarohi, Priya, and me. We decided to have dinner together, savoring the lingering warmth of the day. We laughed, talked, and spent some quality time before finally heading home.
That night, I poured my heart out into my diary, capturing every detail of the day. It was special, it was unforgettable, and it was meant to be written. I know I might be acting a little foolish, but that’s what love does, right? It makes you cherish the simplest moments and hold onto them, even when you know they’re just fleeting memories.
And this is what I wrote.
Here’s a refined version with enhanced emotions and added depth:

Today was the day I finally met him in person.
It felt so surreal, like a dream I never wanted to end.
I wish I could stop time and just look at him forever,
Memorizing every detail, every glance, every breath.
I wish, oh how I wish, I could tell him how handsome he looked,
How his voice felt like music to my soul,
How his gentle care wrapped around me like a warm embrace.
His face, his smile—everything about him felt just right.
Him and only him. He was perfect in every way.
I wish, I truly wish, I could tell him what he means to me,
But I know he doesn’t realize how deeply I love him.
And maybe, in the days to come, he still won’t know
How much I loved him, how much I still do.
But even if he never does, my heart will always carry him,
In whispers of longing and echoes of love untold.

I know we won’t be crossing paths again,our worlds are about to drift apart.
He is leaving, going abroad to chase his dreams, while I will stay here in India, building mine.Is it even possible that we could meet again?Will fate ever bring us back to the same moment, the same place?Will I still love him when that day comes,if it ever does?I wonder how he will look then, if he will still have that same smile that made my heart race.Will he have a girlfriend? A wife?
Or will he be just another stranger in a crowded room, unaware of the love I once held for him?
What if I never see him again?
What if this was the last time,our final goodbye masked as a fleeting moment?
What if, what if, what if...
And as I write this, I feel the tears slipping down my cheeks.A few seconds ago, this memory felt beautiful, almost magical,but my overthinking is turning it into something painful, something I never wanted it to be.My dreams, my hopes,are they slipping through my fingers?No, I tell myself. Let’s not lose hope. Not yet.
This thought keeps running through my mind like an endless loop.I know this was the last time I saw him,And for the next four years, our paths will stay miles apart.
He will be in another country, shaping his future,While I stay here, shaping mine.
And somewhere in between the pursuit of our ambitions,We will forget each other.And the answer to the question I’ve been avoiding is painfully simple,
Yes, we will.</p>
